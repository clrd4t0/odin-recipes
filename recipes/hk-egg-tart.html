    <p>This recipe, courtesy of <a href="https://www.christinesrecipes.com/2009/03/cantonese-egg-tarts.html">Christine's Recipes</a>, is a simple yet beautiful way to make some beautiful and delicious Hong Kong Style Egg Tarts. There are two styles of egg tarts in Hong Kong, the <em>flaky pastry crust egg tarts</em>, and the <em>cookie crust egg tarts</em>. In this recipe, since I am also a huge sucker for cookie crust egg tarts, we will be making those.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p><strong>To follow along, you will need the following ingredients:</strong></p>
    <h3>For the curst:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Plain Flour - 200g</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <h3>Cookie Crust:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Softens the butter by placing it under room temperature. Use an electric mixer to stir it up. Add the caster surgar in two separate pours and keep the mixer on slow until the colour lightens.</li>
        <li>Add the mixed egg in two separate pours and keep the mixer on slow. Then, add the vanilla extract and mix it up. Sieve both plain and cake flour into the mix until it becomes a dough.</li>
        <li>Use a roller to roll the dough into a layer of about 0.5cm. Use a cookie cutter to cut circles that are slightly smaller than the mould. Place the circles into the mould and gently spread the dough with your thumb, bottom to top.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Custard:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Completely dissolve the sugar with hot water. Rest until cool.</li>
        <li>Mix the eggs and evapourated milk, and add the sugar water. Stir until well mixed.</li>
        <li>Sieve the mixture through, make sure no bubbles and solid bits get through. Pour the results into the coocie crusts.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Baking:</h3>
    <p><em>Assuming you have a conventional oven</em></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Ultra high heat on all elements for 3 to 4 minutes. When the custard starts to solidify and the crusts turn golden, change the top element to high and keep ultra high on the bottom element for 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Medium heat on all elements and slightly open the door until the custard rises.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><em>Assuming you have a convection oven</em></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 200C. Put the tarts on the lower level of teh oven for 10 to 15 minutes, or until the crusts turn golden.</li>
        <li>Turn down the heat to 180C until the custard rises slightly. Open the door by 2 to 3 inches and bake for another 10 to 15 minutes until thoroughly cooked. To check if the custard is cooked, insert a toothpick into it. If the toothpick stands, it's cooked.</li>
    </ol>
