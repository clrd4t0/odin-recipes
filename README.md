# odin-recipes
Project: Recipes, made during the course on The Odin Project.

This is a recipes project created when learning via The Odin Project.

This project, in particular, is to practice the basic HTML skills I've learnt.

Hopefully, by the end of this project, I would be able to demonstrate the following:
 - Basic Git skills
	Because I will have to maintain this Git repository
 - Basic HTML skills
	I am guessing I will be required to make links and images and lists

This README.MD will be updated after (and/or maybe during) the project. 

To allow for self-reflection, any and all updates (except for formatting and typos) should be updated below with a dividing line and a time 
code, like this: (----- UPDATE DD/MM/YYYY HH:MM -----)

Good luck to me!

I've completed the project. Feels great to have something I made work and look like it's intended to. Surprisingly I made a mistake when working with git, so I had to repair my repository with the help of Google. Luckily it worked and nothing was lost. This has been a great experience.
